# Contributing
When contributing to the SIF Python Client, it is important to properly communicate the
gist of the contribution. If it is a simple code or editorial fix, simply
explaining this within the GitHub Pull Request (PR) will suffice. But if this
is a larger fix or Enhancement, it should be first discussed with the project
leader or developers.

Please note we have a code of conduct, described below. Please follow it in
all your interactions with the project members and users.

## Pull Request Process

1. Send PRs to the master branch for merge as a pypi release, or development
   if the intention is to add to next pypi release.
2. Follow the existing code style precedent. This does not need to be strictly
   defined as there are many thousands of lines of examples. Note the lack
   of tabs anywhere in the project, parentheses and spacing, documentation
   style, source code layout, variable scoping, and follow the project's
   standards.
3. Test your PR locally, and provide the steps necessary to test for the
   reviewers.
4. The project's default copyright and header have been included in any new
   source files.
5. All (major) changes to SIF Python Client must be documented in
   [docs](docs). If your PR changes a core functionality, please 
   include clear description of the changes in your PR so that the docs 
   can be updated, or better, submit another PR to update the docs directly.
6. If necessary, update the README.md.
7. The pull request will be reviewed by others, and the final merge must be
   done by the project lead, @vsoch (or approved by her).


# Code of Conduct

nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project leader (@vsoch). All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response
that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project
team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of
an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted
separately.

Project maintainers, contributors and users who do not follow or enforce the
